"Will you explain to me what the function mkdir does?

The mkdir function (short for "make directory") is a system call in many operating systems that creates a new directory (also known as a folder) with a specified name. The mkdir function takes one or two arguments: the name of the directory to create, and an optional argument specifying the permissions of the new directory.

Here's an example of how you might use the mkdir function in Python to create a new directory:

python
Copy code
import os

# Create a new directory called "example_directory"
os.mkdir("example_directory")
In this example, we're using the os module in Python to call the mkdir function and create a new directory called "example_directory" in the current working directory. If the directory already exists, mkdir will raise an error.

You can also use the mkdir function with an optional argument to set the permissions of the new directory. For example:

python
Copy code
import os

# Create a new directory called "example_directory" with permissions set to 755
os.mkdir("example_directory", 0o755)
In this example, we're using the 0o755 argument to set the permissions of the new directory to rwxr-xr-x. This means that the owner of the directory has read, write, and execute permissions, while others have read and execute permissions.
